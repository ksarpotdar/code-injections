# code-injections
Some HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code injections I have created to use with [@Lor-Saba's Code Injector chrome extension](https://github.com/Lor-Saba/Code-Injector)

## code explaination and use
All pure JavaScript injections don't require the code injector and can be used by simply copying them into the console
All code has been tested on Chrome only

### Edit-Page
This injection will enable or disable the ability to edit a webpage as if it were a word document.

### Edrolo-Cheat
This injection will highlight the correct answer when you hover over it.

### Google-Ads
This injection will Remove every google advertisement from a webpage and will loop every 1000ms to stop them from reappearing.

### OWOify
This injection was not created by me so I dont take credit for it however I do not know where I got it from or who made it.
This injection will "OWOify" a webpage by running through the text on the page and altering it.
If you don't know what i mean by OWOify, well.. you'll see.

### Wordle-Cheat
This injection allows you to instantly guess the correct wordle answer by pressing the spacebar.

### Wordle-Clone-Cheat
This injection works the same as Wordle-Cheat however it also displays the correct word in the center of the screen.
This injection works for "Race mode".

### Youtube-Ads
This injection works similarly to Google-Ads and does 4 things.
1. Removes the ad in the top right of the page above the recommended videos.
2. Removes ads that appear on top of videos.
3. Automatically presses the skip button.
4. Removes all google ads (Exactly the same as the Google-Ads injection).
